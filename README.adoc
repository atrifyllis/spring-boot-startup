Users with ADMIN role can access the REST endpoint for user(s):

http(s)://localhost:8443/api/users

=== Keystore
To create the keystore the following command was used (password is 'tomcat'):

`keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -storetype PKCS12 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore keystore.p12 -validity 4000`

NOTE: HTTPS has been disabled for the moment, probably it should be enabled only in production mode
