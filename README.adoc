= Spring Boot Starter project

== General Info

<port> in the following is either 8076 for http (dev mode) or 8443 for https (prod mode)
=== Database initialization
An H2 in-memory database is used for this project, initialized at startup.
The database is initialized using http(s)://flywaydb.org/[flyway].

=== H2 database
You can browse the database here: http(s)://localhost:<port>/h2-console entering in JDBC URL the following: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`

=== HAL browser
Go to http(s)://localhost:<port>/api for browsing the exposed REST API

== Entry points

=== Users
Users with ADMIN role can access the REST endpoint for user(s):

http(s)://localhost:<port>/api/users

=== Keystore
To create the keystore for Tomcat HTTPS the following command was used (password is 'tomcat'):

`keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -storetype PKCS12 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore keystore.p12 -validity 4000`

To create the keystore for JWT signing the following command was used:

`keytool -genkeypair -alias jwt -keyalg RSA -keypass jwtjwt -keystore jwt.jks -storepass jwtjwt -validity 4000`

Then to export the public key separately the command:

`keytool -list -rfc --keystore jwt.jks | openssl x509 -inform pem -pubkey`

Then copy paste only the Public Key to a separate file. (This command needs openssl installed on your machine. Alternatively you can use a tool like Keystore Explorer for the export).

=== Production

Running with spring profile 'prod' will run in HTTPS mode.

NOTE: A MySQL database is needed for production mode with name 'spring_boot_startup'. You must change username password in application-prod.yaml file.
